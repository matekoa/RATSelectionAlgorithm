# RATSelectionAlgorithm

The purpose of this project was to design a vertical handoff algorithm using the multi-criteria decisionmaking
technique in a heterogeneous network.

The SAW technique was investigated with randomized user weightings for 1000 users. The algorithm
was then implemented in MATLAB as shown in Appendix A. The attributes that constituted the
decision-making criteria were: cost (R per MB), datarate (Mbps), and delay (latency in ms). Loading
traffic of each RAT varied when a certain criterion was given greater importance over the others. This
is because when vertical handoff is initiated in user-centric networks, the user is connected to the RAT
with the greatest weight according to that userâ€™s preferences.
In summary, the project achieved the goals that were set out, by designing and demonstrating a
Multi-Criteria Decision Making Algorithm to carry out handoff decisions for users in a heterogeneous
network made up of 3 different Radio Access Technologies. The project also compared effects of user
weights assigned to each RAT-selection criterion.
